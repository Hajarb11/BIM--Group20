• Describe the use case you have chosen
	◦ We have chosen the Structure use case which will focus on searching through the BIM model for the structural elements, to make sure the building conditions and specifications are met, and to perform a structural analysis of the model  
• Who is the use case for?
	◦ The use case is a consultant tool for architects, engineers and contractors
• What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case
	◦ Structural Analysis and Design
• What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)
	◦ Ifc Beam, Wall, Column, and Slab 
• What disciplinary analysis does it require?
	◦ Structural analysis alongside an architectural model
• What building elements are you interested in?
	◦ Beams, Columns, Walls, Slabs
• What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?
	◦ Architectual IFC model and Cost Estimation
• What is the input data for your use case?
	◦ Load Data, Areas and Volumes, Surfaces, Dimensions, Geotechnical properties
• What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?
	◦ LCA, and the rest.
