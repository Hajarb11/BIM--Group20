## Question 2: Markdown File describing our Use Case

### Describe the use case you have chosen
Our use case is Structural Use Case and a bit of code validation to go along with it. To elaborate, our goal is to formulate a process which will enable us to extract structural elements from an IFC model, and generate a simplified structural model, which can be read and utilized for Structural Analysis in any FEM software.  
	
### Who is the use case for?
The use case primarily for Structural Engineers and consultants, who are required to extrapolate useful information for 'Structural Analysis' from IFC models. Moreover, this usecase is also useful for analysis of existing structure, especially in cases where existing design needs to be changed or additional construction is planned on the existing structure. This tool is also useful for validating the conformance of materials and elements with specified codes, before a structure is built.

Structural Design is an iterative process, so LCA will be waiting for finalization of material type and quantities used by Structural Designer. Cost Estimation and Build Operate will also require a finalized structural layout as they will need member dimensions and material types for analyzing their use cases. Fire Safety Engineer will also analyze the Structural design and recommend structural changes in the modelâ€‹
	
### What disciplinary (non BIM) expertise did you use to solve the use case?
To address this usecase, a working knowledge of Structural Analysis and Design is required. Additionally, working knowledge of FEM software and python is also a pre-requisite for solving this use case  
	
### What IFC concepts did you use in your script (would you use in your script)
Finding lengths of various Ifc element arrays, calling a Ifc file to extract information from it, using the called Ifc file to extract element attributes and element properties such as lengths. Using the Ifc file to display the element count for various structural elements and also displaying their attributes. Also, getting location of various elements will be required to enable them to be used with an FEM software. 

To elaborate: 
1. .by_type() functions were access elements in the model and len() was used to count the number of elements in each array
2. .IsDefined, IfcRelDefinesByProperties, IfcPropertySet is used to access property sets associated with each element in the model
3. .IsDefined, RelatingPropertyDefinition.HasProperties was used to access specific properties such as lengths, widths etc. for various elements defined earlier
4. IfcStore is used to access information of the BIM project currently the user is working with 

	
### What disciplinary analysis does it require?
Structural Analysis and Code Validation

### What building elements are you interested in?
Primarily, the following elements will serve as adequate inputs for Structural Use Case: Beams, Columns, Walls, Slabs & Roof

### What (use cases) need to be done before you can start your use case?
Architectual IFC model, Code Validation, LCA, Fire-Safety 

### What is the input data for your use case?
Dimensions of the structural elements, Material usage of various elements, Location of the structural elements, Load Data such as wind, gravity, seismic and live loads, Element joints/connections data

### What other use cases are waiting for your use case to complete?
Code Validation, LCA, Fire since code validation will ensure that current materials and standards are in compliance. LCA will finalize the materials to be used in the building, which is an essential component to influence the structural design of the building. Lastly, fire safety design can also be classified as a structural engineering design process; however, it uses a more holistic approach to design members. The output and the results of the fire safety design will finalize the materials and elements to be used in the project and will serve as an input to the structural design and analysis process
